# Sem_VI_MINI_PROJECT
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in agricultural disease detection with a focus on potato crops.

# About
This project involves building a deep learning model for classifying plant diseases, specifically focusing on potatoes. The technical stack includes TensorFlow and Keras for model development, along with various preprocessing techniques. 


# Key Steps
1) The dataset consists of 2152 images belonging to three classes: Potato Early Blight, Potato Late Blight, and Potato Healthy.
2) The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets. The model architecture comprises convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers.
3) Over 40 epochs of training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the validation set.
4) Data augmentation and preprocessing are utilized to improve generalization.
5) The trained model is saved for future use.
